Full Project Proposal: <b> [POLish EMotIons Classifier] </b> 
</p>


**Background**  

The polish language lacks large quantities of texts representing certain human emotions, therefore training an accurate classifier is problematic. We face this issue by combining the dataset of 4211 tweets annotated by 31 annotators with weakly supervised datasets. We plan to improve the quality of classification, especially on the minority classes. 
By combining bigger data sources we aim to train The First Polish Classifier of Emotions in Text Data.


**Scientific/technological questions of your project**  

- How to obtain the additional datasets?
- How to train a classifier with weakly supervised data?
- How much weakly-supervised data can improve the model performance on the validation dataset?




**Objectives of the project** (according to [[1]](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-measurable-goals-and-objectives.html
))

Improved F1 macro, when compared to the base dataset
1 Chrome extension published in the Chrome Web Store


**The final product of the project**  

Trained classifier in the form of an open-source project on Github
Twitter scraper chrome extension, which can be used to annotate emotions in the user‚Äôs tweets

**Scope**
